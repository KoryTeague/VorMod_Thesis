	abstract = {Next generation networks are designed to improve connectivity and capacity, adding to the current range of available services and expanding their reachability. For these systems to work, they need to be compatible with legacy technologies in addition to making use of (limited) available spectrum resources. This is one of the reasons why spectrum sharing has been at the forefront of the list of enablers for such systems. From federal commercial sharing to finding opportunities in millimeter-wave spectrum, we have witnessed the formulation of multiple approaches to making spectrum sharing happen.

Existing work on spectrum sharing is wide ranging and includes technical as well as market-based approaches. The study of spectrum markets is of particular interest, as it merges a market approach with the technical limitations inherent to electromagnetic spectrum. In this manner, spectrum markets settings have called for different definitions of spectrum-related resources as a means to increase market thickness and thus improve the opportunities for market success. In a similar vein, we find proposals of network models which aim at adapting technical definitions of spectrum resources, such as those that are the product of virtualization. In this work, we adopt a market perspective for spectrum sharing within the context of more comprehensive network definitions such as those envisioned for next generation networks. To this end, we explore matching market concepts and middleman theory in order to shed light on factors that may impact the performance and, ultimately, the success of spectrum markets.},

	keywords = {spectrum markets, spectrum sharing, dynamic spectrum access, resource virtualization},
	url = {http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/33130/},
	abstract = {The creation of secondary spectrum markets emerged as a means to enable flexible spectrum- use mechanisms and abandon a rigid spectrum allocation and assignment approach, which resulted in severe inefficiencies in the use of this resource. At the core of the deployment of spectrum markets lie the definition of electromagnetic spectrum as a tradable commodity, the reallocation of spectrum rights, the creation of incentives for resource owners to lease or transfer their spectrum holdings and the appropriate regulatory framework to support and enforce market transactions. It follows that the viability of spectrum markets depends on technical, economic and regulatory frameworks to render this approach a meaningful alternative for spectrum allocation and assignment.
	
In this research work, we explore the conditions associated with spectrum markets viability. For this purpose, we utilize Agent-based Modeling in order to study markets under different commodity definitions as well as network configurations. These configurations are gathered in three research stages, which start with the analysis of markets as stand-alone institutions where electromagnetic frequencies, without any associated infrastructure (i.e., ?naked? spectrum), are traded. This allows us to explore the degree in which the limitations in spectrum fungibility impact the trading process and outcome.

In the second stage, we focus on refining the tradable commodity in such a way that allows to circumvent the physical limitations of spectrum. To this end, we rely on technologies such as LTE-Advanced and virtualization in order to define a fungible, virtualized spectrum commodity and explore the benefits that this provides for market deployment.

The final stage aims at extending the range of applicability of virtualized commodities and providing opportunities that could address current spectrum service and connectivity requirements. Hence, we explore markets as part of more complex network arrangements, where we rely on middleman theory, matching markets and simple auctions in order to enable resource trading. This requires the analysis of multiple factors that impact market design from the definition of tradable commodities to the characterization of the role and objectives of market participants. These factors stem from relevant technical, economics and regulatory frameworks, which we explore to determine whether our spectrum markets proposal can be considered as a viable and applicable solution.},

Through simple encodings from such domains into the set of words over a finite alphabet these problems can be converted into language recognition problems, and we can inquire into their computational complexity. It is reasonable to consider such a problem satisfactorily solved when an algorithm for its solution is found which terminates within a number of steps bounded by a polynomial in the length of the input. We show that a large number of classic unsolved problems of covering, matching, packing, routing, assignment and sequencing are equivalent, in the sense that either each of them possesses a polynomial-bounded algorithm or none of them does.},

	abstract = {As the name suggests, multi-objective optimisation involves optimising a number of objectives simultaneously. The problem becomes challenging when the objectives are of conflicting characteristics to each other, that is, the optimal solution of an objective function is different from that of the other. In the course of solving such problems, with or without the presence of constraints, these problems give rise to a set of trade-off optimal solutions, popularly known as Pareto-optimal solutions. Because of the multiplicity in solutions, these problems were proposed to be solved suitably using evolutionary algorithms using a population approach in its search procedure. Starting with parameterised procedures in early 90s, the so-called evolutionary multi-objective optimisation (EMO) algorithms is now an established field of research and application with many dedicated texts and edited books, commercial softwares and numerous freely downloadable codes, a biannual conference series running successfully since 2001, special sessions and workshops held at all major evolutionary computing conferences, and full-time researchers from universities and industries from all around the globe. In this chapter, we provide a brief introduction to its operating principles and outline the current research and application studies of evolutionary multi-objective optmisation (EMO).},
